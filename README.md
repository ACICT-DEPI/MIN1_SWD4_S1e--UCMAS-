This is an application directed at aiding in UC MAS (Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System) training.

## Overview
The **UC MAS App** (Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System) is a mobile application designed to provide students with an interactive and competitive platform for practicing and improving their math skills. The app offers automated tests with real-time grading, performance tracking, and social features that encourage students to engage in healthy competition with their peers.

## Features
- **Automated Testing and Feedback**: 
  Students can take timed practice tests with automatic grading and instant feedback on their performance.
  
- **Performance Tracking**: 
  A visual chart displays the number of questions answered and tracks progress over time, helping students see their improvements after each attempt.
  
- **Leaderboard and Social Competition**: 
  Students can compare their scores with friends, search for other users, and view a global leaderboard, which is sorted by country to foster competition.

- **No Paper, No Manual Marking**: 
  The app eliminates the need for printed tests, manual grading, or starting/stopping a timer, reducing the effort required by both students and educators.

## Problem Statement
1. Traditional paper-based tests require printing, manual grading, and time-tracking by the teacher, which consumes a lot of time and resources.
2. Students lack a competitive environment where they can compare their progress and engage with their peers to improve performance.
3. Tracking a student's progress over time is difficult and requires manual calculation and record-keeping.

## Objectives
- To automate test generation, timing, and grading to reduce the teacher's workload.
- To provide real-time feedback and performance tracking for students.
- To foster a competitive and motivating environment through social features and leaderboards.
